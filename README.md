# Adam & Lauren's Wedding
A webite providing information for our wedding happening in August 2024. 

The goal of this website is to provide information to guests about the wedding itself and to help them with getting accomodation in the Kilkenny. 
Thereis also a section to RSVP to the wedding that for now is the custom form dump but will be expanded upon to be operational in the coming weeks.
